Project Comet REST API Specification
------------------------------------

-   The **Content Type** of the API is JSON. When making HTTP requests
    to this API you should specify the following headers:
    -   Accept: application/json
    -   Content-type: application/json
    
-   A **Collection** is a group of Resources of a given type.
    -   A **GET** request retrieves a list of summarized Resource
        representations This summary *may* include all or some of the
        Resource properties but *must* include a link to the full
        Resource representation.
    -   A **POST** request will create a new Resource in the Collection.
        The set of Resource properties *must* be specified as a JSON
        object in the request body.
    -   No other HTTP methods are supported for Collections

-   A **Resource** is a representation of a singular object in the API
    (eg. Virtual Machine).
    -   A **GET** request retrieves the full Resource representation.
    -   A **DELETE** request will delete the Resource. This request
        *may* contain a JSON object which specifies optional parameters.
    -   A **PUT** request is used to modify the properties of a Resource
        (eg. Change the name of a Virtual Machine). This kind of request
        *must not* alter the live state of the Resource. Only *actions*
        may alter live state.
    -   A **POST** request commits an *action* upon a Resource (eg.
        Start a Virtual Machine). This request is made to a URI relative
        to the Resource URI. Available *actions* are described within
        the *actions* property of a Resource representation. The request
        body *must* contain a JSON object which specifies parameters.
-   URIs begin with a '/' to indicate the root of the API.
    -   Variable segments in the URI begin with a ':' and should
        replaced with the appropriate resource identifier.

-   start: Power on a VM
-   poweroff: Power off a VM forcefully. Note this action may produce
    undesirable results, for example unflushed disk cache in the guest.
-   shutdown: Shut down a VM graceful. This action issue shutdown
    request to guest. And the guest will react this request. Note the
    guest OS may ignore the request.
-   reset: Reset a VM immediately without the guest OS shutdown. It
    emulates the power reset button on a machine. Note that there is a
